//Output = B.Driving Electric Car

//The drive() method in the Car class does not override the version in the Automobile class since the method is not visible to the Car class.
//The drive() method in the Electric Car class is a valid override of the method in the Car class, with the access modifier expanding in the subclass.
//For thes reasons, the code compiles,and Option D is incorrect.
//In the main() method, the object created is an Electric Car, even if it is assigned to a Car reference.
//Due to polymorphism, the method from the Electric Car will be invoked,making Option B the correct answer.
