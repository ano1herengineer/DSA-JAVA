Question 3 

Algorithm A and B have a worst case running time of O(n) and O(log n),
respectively.Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A.

Answer = False:

The Big O notation provides a asymptotic comparison in the running time of algorithms.
For n < n0, algorithm A might run faster than algorithm B, for instance.
